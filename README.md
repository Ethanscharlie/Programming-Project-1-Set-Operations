# Programming-Project-1-Set-Operations
Demonstrates various operations on sets and multisets. 

First, a universal set U is defined.
Part 1 takes two subsets of the universal set U and performs the specified operation on the two subsets. Then, a bitstring/boolean array and the resulting subset is displayed. 
Part 2 takes two multisets of a universal set U and performs the specified operation on the two multisets. Then, a structure (containing the amount of each element in the resulting multiset) and the resulting multiset is displayed.
